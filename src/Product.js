If you are confused and not aware of these facts, wait no more. Because now you can get that rush while playing and learn something about the environment too! Crazy ha? </p>

           <h1>The Journey of Move & Müll</h1>
            <p>
Games are becoming one of the most interesting ways of promoting environmental awareness. Our very first game - Move&Müll, a game on waste separation which uses intrinsic motivation to encourage environmental literacy.
It aims to change the future of gaming with a fun and explorative casual game that teaches people about ecological sustainability. 
It offers the smartphone generation the opportunity to make conscious decisions about the environment and therefore to play the role in the real world.

                   <p>
Some initial sketches of how Move&Müll was designed. Initially, based in a city environment, the player runs around the city cleaning the streets and the ocean and scoring points for sorting the waste items into the right coloured bins.
Although we had a good concept, the intrinsic motivation was lacking. So, one day we came up with the idea of telling our players the story of the main character through our games.

           <h1>Meet Bob</h1>
            <p>
He is a janitor. A WORTHY janitor. Wearing his invisible cape, he silently swoops by each house everyday, and cleans the city off the waste. He is the hero who deserves all the fame. And he sets on a journey to make the world a better place.

Play along with Bob in Move&Müll to clean the city, sort the waste carefully and earn the maximum points to join the LEAGUE OF WORTHY JANITORS.
